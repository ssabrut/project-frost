      "Okay, so I need to figure out who the first person to land on the moon was. Let me start by recalling what I know. I think it was someone from NASA's Apollo missions. I remember hearing about Neil Armstrong being the first, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, wasn't there another astronaut with him on the same mission? Maybe Buzz Aldrin? Or was he the second one? Let me think.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe the Apollo 11 mission was the one that first landed on the moon. Neil Armstrong was the commander, right? So he would have been the first to step out of the lunar module. Then Buzz Aldrin followed him. But I should double-check the details to be certain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, there's also Michael Collins, but he stayed in the command module orbiting the moon, so he didn't land. So the two who landed were Armstrong and Aldrin. The question is specifically about the first person. So Armstrong was the first to step onto the surface. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the date was July 20, 1969. That's a date I've heard associated with the moon landing. The famous quote \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind\" was said by Armstrong when he stepped onto the moon. \n",
      "\n",
      "But let me make sure there's no confusion with other missions. For example, the Soviet Union had some lunar missions, but they were unmanned, right? The first human on the moon was definitely an American astronaut. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another point to consider: sometimes people mix up the first person in space with the first on the moon. Yuri Gagarin was the first human in space in 1961, but the moon landing was later. \n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, the answer should be Neil Armstrong as part of Apollo 11 in 1969. But I want to confirm the exact details. Maybe check the order of events: Apollo 11 was the mission, Armstrong was the commander, so he stepped out first. Aldrin came out second. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's correct. But maybe there's a common misconception here. Let me think if there's any other candidate. No, I don't think so. The Apollo 11 mission is widely recognized as the first manned lunar landing, and Armstrong was the first to step on the surface. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer should be Neil Armstrong. But just to be thorough, maybe there's a different perspective. For example, some sources might mention the lunar module pilot versus the commander, but the commander is typically the first to exit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's standard procedure. So I'm pretty confident now. The first person to land on the moon was Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.\n",
